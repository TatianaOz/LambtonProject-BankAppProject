## The minimum requirements:
The client/user can do the following:
1.	log in, using the access card number and a pin number
2.	Check the balance of each account (the client can have multiple accounts)
3.	Pay utility bills
4.	Transfer money from account to account for the same client or different client.

## Explanation:
The app will not let the user create an account, so once the app gets running data should be already there (either you use an internal database, or external or if using arrays without a real database).

## The utility bills: 
The user needs to choose one of theses choices:
-	Hydro
-	Water
-	Gas
-	Phone
Let the user then enter a subscription no. and the amount then chooses the account to pay from (if the user has multiple accounts) then click pay to subtract the amount from that account balance. Then give the user an option to save the number for next time.

## Money transfer:
-   If form an account to another account for the same client then choose the account from and the account to and the amount, then subtract from here and add there.
- 	If to another client, then enter the client name and account no. and do the transfer, send an email to that client telling them about the money transfer.
- 	You have to take care of the design, try to create a professional design and enough screens upon need. 

## Note: 
You can choose any type of database or without a database if you can.
If you want to add more transactions, more features to the app that will be an advantage.
If you want to create a totally different application with a different idea, then you can but it should have similar features.
